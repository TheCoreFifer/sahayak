# Upcoming Features for Sahayak - Hackathon "Go Beyond" Plan

This document outlines the high-impact, Google Cloud-integrated features we will build to make Sahayak a winning hackathon project. The focus is on innovation, real-world impact, and showcasing a deep understanding of the Google ecosystem.

### üöÄ Feature 1: The AI Reading Coach (with Advanced Audio Analysis)

**The Core Idea:** Go beyond simple speech-to-text. We will create a feature that provides a deep, human-like analysis of a student's reading performance by having Gemini 1.5 directly analyze the student's audio.

**The "Wow" Factor:**
- **Multimodal Analysis:** Instead of just comparing text, Gemini will analyze the audio for fluency, hesitation, pace, and pronunciation, providing insights previously only a human could offer.
- **Personalized Coaching:** The AI will deliver encouraging, actionable feedback, acting as a personal reading tutor for every student.

**Google Ecosystem Integration:**
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash API:** For direct audio input and multimodal analysis.
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API:** As a potential fallback or for generating a written transcript to display alongside the analysis.
- **Google Sheets API:** After each assessment, the results (Words Per Minute, Accuracy %, Fluency Score) are automatically added as a new row in a private Google Sheet for that student, creating a progress tracker over time.
- **Google Docs API:** A "Generate Report" button will create a formal, printable progress report in a Google Doc, which a teacher can share with parents.

**Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Frontend:**
    -   Create a new page `/reading-coach`.
    -   UI will display a reading passage (generated by another Gemini call or selected from a library).
    -   A "Record" button will capture the student's audio using the browser's `MediaRecorder` API.
    -   On completion, the audio blob is sent to the backend.
    -   The results view will show the AI's feedback card, highlighted transcript, and buttons to "Export to Google Docs" or "View Progress in Sheets".
2.  **Backend (`/api/assess-reading`):**
    -   Receives the audio file and the original text ID.
    -   Sends the audio and text to the Gemini 1.5 Flash model with the detailed "reading coach" prompt.
    -   Parses the JSON response from Gemini.
    -   (Optional) Use Google Sheets/Docs SDKs to handle the export functionality based on user action.
    -   Returns the comprehensive analysis to the frontend.

### üé≤ Feature 2: The "Lesson-to-Life" Content Suite

**The Core Idea:** Transform any lesson topic into a rich, interactive, and multi-format learning experience that can be used directly in the classroom. This combines and enhances the "Game Factory" and "Visual Aids" concepts.

**The "Wow" Factor:**
- **Multi-Format Generation:** From a single topic (e.g., "The Water Cycle"), the AI can generate a story, a visual aid concept, an interactive game, AND find a relevant educational video.
- **Instant Classroom Tools:** The generated content isn't just text; it's exported into ready-to-use formats like Google Slides and Docs.

**Google Ecosystem Integration:**
- **Gemini API:** To generate the content for stories, game questions, and visual aid descriptions.
- **YouTube Data API:** To find and embed relevant, child-safe educational videos for the given topic and language.
- **Google Slides API:** A "Create Quiz Game" button will take the AI-generated questions and automatically create a simple, clickable multiple-choice quiz in a new Google Slides presentation in the teacher's Drive.
- **Google Drive API:** To manage and store the generated Slides and Docs.

**Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Frontend:**
    -   On the "Local Content" or a new "Lesson Tools" page, a teacher inputs a topic, grade, and language.
    -   The results are displayed in a tabbed view: "Story", "Visual Aid", "Game", "Video".
    -   The "Game" tab has a button: "Export Quiz to Google Slides".
    -   The "Video" tab shows an embedded YouTube player.
2.  **Backend (`/api/generate-lesson-suite`):**
    -   Receives topic, grade, language.
    -   **Step 1:** Call Gemini to generate a story, visual aid ideas, and quiz questions in one structured JSON response.
    -   **Step 2:** Call the YouTube Data API with the topic to search for educational videos. Filter for high-quality, kid-friendly channels.
    -   **Step 3:** Return all of this information to the frontend.
3.  **Backend (`/api/create-google-slide-quiz`):**
    -   Receives the JSON for the quiz questions.
    -   Uses the Google Slides API to create a new presentation, add a title slide, and then one slide per question with clickable links for the answers.

### ü§ù Feature 3: The Sahayak Community Platform

**The Core Idea:** Empower teachers to share their best-generated content, creating a collaborative, nationwide repository of high-quality, localized teaching aids. This builds directly on the Firebase integration prize.

**The "Wow" Factor:**
- **Cross-Language Collaboration:** A teacher in one state can create a worksheet in their local language. Another teacher can find it, and with one click, translate the entire worksheet into their own language.
- **Community-Driven Curation:** Teachers can upvote the most effective resources, causing the best content to surface to the top.

**Google Ecosystem Integration:**
- **Firebase Authentication:** Secure teacher login and profiles.
- **Firestore:** The database for storing all shared content (worksheets, lesson plans, games), along with metadata like `author`, `grade`, `subject`, `language`, and `upvotes`.
- **Cloud Storage for Firebase:** To store related media like uploaded textbook images.
- **Cloud Translation AI API:** The powerhouse behind the one-click translation feature.

**Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Firebase Setup:** Configure Auth, Firestore, and Storage. Create Firestore security rules to ensure teachers can only edit their own content.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   Add a "Community" tab to the main navigation.
    -   This page will feature a searchable, filterable feed of resources from Firestore.
    -   Each resource card will have an upvote button, the author's name, and a "Translate" button/dropdown.
    -   When a teacher generates content in the app, they'll see a "Share to Community" button.
3.  **Backend:**
    -   Create new endpoints to interact with Firestore (`/api/community/share`, `/api/community/vote`).
    -   Create an endpoint `/api/translate-resource` that takes a Firestore document ID and a target language. It will fetch the document, send its text fields to the Cloud Translation AI, and return the translated content.

### ‚ú® Hackathon "Secret Weapon"

**The "Class Profile" Trick:**
- Before a teacher starts using the app, have them complete a one-time "Class Profile": `Grades Taught`, `Primary Language`, `Student Interests (e.g., cricket, farming, animals)`, `Location`.
- **This profile is saved and automatically pre-pended as context to every single prompt sent to Gemini.**
- This is a simple but incredibly powerful UX trick. It makes the AI feel hyper-personalized and "smart" because the teacher doesn't have to repeat the context. All generated content will magically be more relevant.
