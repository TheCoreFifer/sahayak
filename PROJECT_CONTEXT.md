# Sahayak - AI Teaching Assistant for Multi-Grade Classrooms

## Problem Statement
**Empowering teachers in multi-grade classrooms across India**

### The Challenge
In countless under-resourced schools across India, a single teacher often manages multiple grades in one classroom. These educators are stretched thin, lacking the time and tools to create localized teaching aids, address diverse learning levels, and personalize education for every child. The challenge is to build a true AI companion that lessens this burden and amplifies their impact.

### The Objective
Build an AI-powered teaching assistant ("Sahayak") that empowers teachers in multi-grade, low-resource environments. The agent must be a versatile tool for preparation, content creation, and differentiation.
