# Sahayak - AI Teaching Assistant Memory

## üöÄ CURRENT SESSION - WEEKLY PLANNER V2 OVERHAUL

### üéØ **WEEKLY PLANNER REDESIGNED & REBUILT FROM SCRATCH** ‚úÖ
**Latest Session Critical Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Core React Error**: Resolved the "Objects are not valid as a React child" error by creating a `renderContent` function that correctly interprets the API's data structure and renders valid JSX for stories and worksheets.
- ‚úÖ **Complete UI/UX Overhaul**: Rebuilt the component with a clean, Google-style multi-step workflow (Upload ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Generate).
- ‚úÖ **Implemented Editable Grades**: Users can now freely add or remove grade levels after the initial analysis, providing full customization.
- ‚úÖ **Added Multi-Week Planning**: Introduced a "Number of Weeks" input, allowing teachers to generate structured lesson plans for multiple weeks at a time.
- ‚úÖ **Removed Visual Aids**: Streamlined the feature to focus on the core planning assets (stories and worksheets) as requested.
- ‚úÖ **Robust Preview Modal**: Ensured the preview modal is fully functional and correctly displays formatted content for all generated assets.
- ‚úÖ **Refined Generation Logic**: The entire asset generation process was refactored to be more efficient and to handle the new multi-week structure.

### üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS**

**Fixing the React Child Error:**
A `renderContent` function was created to act as a gatekeeper, inspecting the `asset.content` object and ensuring that only valid, renderable JSX is returned. This prevents raw objects from being passed into the render tree.
```tsx
const renderContent = (asset: GeneratedAsset) => {
  const { content, type } = asset;
  if (!content) return <p>No content available.</p>;

  if (type === 'story') {
    // Correctly access and render the 'story' string property
    return <p>{content.story}</p>;
  }

  if (type === 'worksheet') {
    // Map over the 'exercises' array to create a list of JSX elements
    return content.exercises?.map((ex: any, index: number) => (
      <div key={index}>{/*...render exercise...*/}</div>
    ));
  }
  
  // Fallback for unexpected data structures
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(content, null, 2)}</pre>;
};
```

**Editable Grades UI:**
Managed an `editableGrades` state array and used input fields and buttons to allow users to add/remove grade strings.
```tsx
const [editableGrades, setEditableGrades] = useState<string[]>([]);
// ... UI with map, input, and add/remove handlers
```

**Multi-Week Plan Structure:**
The data is now structured into a `WeeklyPlan[]` array, where each element contains the week number and its associated assets. Generation loops through the number of weeks specified by the user.
```tsx
interface WeeklyPlan {
  week: number;
  assets: GeneratedAsset[];
}
const [weeklyPlans, setWeeklyPlans] = useState<WeeklyPlan[]>([]);
```

## üöÄ CURRENT SESSION - API Refactoring & Bug Fixes

### üéØ **API Centralization & Refactoring Complete** ‚úÖ
**Latest Session Critical Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ **Centralized API Service**: All frontend API calls have been moved into a dedicated `src/services/api.ts` service for maintainability.
- ‚úÖ **File Downloader Service**: Client-side file generation logic (PDF, Word) has been moved to its own `src/services/fileDownloader.ts` service.
- ‚úÖ **Resolved Import Errors**: Fixed all compilation errors caused by the refactoring by updating component imports to point to the new centralized services.
- ‚úÖ **Health Check Fixed**: Corrected a 404 error by aligning the frontend API call with the backend Genkit route for `/api/health`.
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Management**: Added `jspdf`, `jspdf-autotable`, and `file-saver` to handle client-side document generation.
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX Enhancements**: The `QuestionGenerator` component has been redesigned with a more modern, multi-step layout.

### üîß **HEALTH CHECK - ENDPOINT FIXED**
**Problem:** The frontend was calling `/api/health`, but the Genkit server was only listening on `/health`, resulting in a 404 error.
**Solution:**
```typescript
// genkit/src/index.ts - Corrected Route
app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    version: '3.0.0',
    model: 'gemini-2.0-flash'
  });
});
```
- **Result:** The frontend can now successfully connect to the backend, and the "AI Ready" status indicator works correctly.

### üß† **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE**
**Frontend Services:**
```
src/services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.ts (All backend API calls)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fileDownloader.ts (Client-side PDF & Word generation)
```
- **Benefit:** This separation of concerns makes the code cleaner, easier to debug, and more scalable. Future API changes will only need to be made in one place.

### üé® **QUESTION GENERATOR - UI/UX OVERHAUL**
- **New Layout:** A multi-step, guided interface has been implemented, improving usability.
- **Clearer Steps:** Configuration, Skills & Types, and Content Input are now in distinct sections.
- **Improved Styling:** Adopted a consistent, modern design that matches the rest of the application.
