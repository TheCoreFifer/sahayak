The Challenge: In countless under-resourced schools across India, a single teacher often manages multiple grades in one classroom. These educators are stretched thin, lacking the time and tools to create localized teaching aids, address diverse learning levels, and personalize education for every child. The challenge is to build a true AI companion that lessens this burden and amplifies their impact.
The Objective: Build an AI-powered teaching assistant ("Sahayak") that empowers teachers in multi-grade, low-resource environments. The agent must be a versatile tool for preparation, content creation, and differentiation. The agent should:
Generate Hyper-Local Content: Allow a teacher to make requests in their local language (e.g., "Create a story in Marathi about farmers to explain different soil types") and receive simple,xx culturally relevant content generated by Gemini.
Create Differentiated Materials: Enable a teacher to upload a photo of a textbook page, and using a multimodal Gemini model, instantly generate multiple versions of a worksheet tailored to different grade levels present in the classroom.
Act as an Instant Knowledge Base: Provide simple, accurate explanations for complex student questions ("Why is the sky blue?") in the local language, complete with easy-to-understand analogies.
Design Visual Aids: Generate simple line drawings or charts based on a teacher's description, which can be easily replicated on a blackboard to explain concepts like the water cycle.
Go Beyond: Innovate with features like audio-based reading assessments (using Vertex AI Speech-to-Text), on-the-fly educational game generation, or AI-powered weekly lesson planners that structure activities and save teachers valuable time.
Tech Stack: Use of Google AI technologies is mandatory.
